    "content": "In a deep dark forest, where the Sun never touches lives an old woman of immense power. She is called Baba Yaga, and all who meet here fear and despair. She lives in an ancient hut, with one striking feature. Instead of reaching the ground, the hut has horrible, large chicken legs and chicken wings. On the edge of the forest is a small town, and you live in this town with your father and your stepmother and half-sisters. Since your mother passed away, your life has been miserable because your stepmother and her family treat you badly when your father leaves for work. The only possession you have left is a pretty doll, which is said to aid those in great need."
